# riot_api_tft_data

This was part of a project to ultimately do some modeling of TFT team/item composition outcomes, but I've moved to other projects for the team being.  
This repo isn't a great example of good python practices, but could hopefully be helpful to someone learning Python, API's, Cloud, or Data Wrangling.  

Warning for beginners: This code won't work out of the box, as it's currently set to use a `config.py` file to access my Riot API key and a `google_auth.json` file to connect to my Google Cloud account/project. These files are mentioned in `.gitgnore`, but since the point of sharing this publicly was for educational use, I thought this might be good to mention explicitly.

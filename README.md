# riot_api_tft_data

This was part of a project to ultimately do some modeling of TFT team/item composition outcomes, but I've moved to other projects for the team being.  
This repo isn't a great example of good python practices, but could hopefully be helpful to someone learning Python, API's, Cloud, or Data Wrangling.
